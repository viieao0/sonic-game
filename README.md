🎮 Game Description

This project is a custom-built 2D platformer created using JavaScript and HTML Canvas, inspired by the classic Sonic games.
The player can run, jump, leap, shoot, collect rings, defeat a regular enemy, and finally battle a moving boss that throws explosives.

The game includes:

Fully coded physics (gravity, velocity, collision detection)

Dynamic camera following the player

Moving platforms, hazards, and enemies

Collectible ring system

A full boss battle with HP, attacks, and win/loss conditions

A Green Hill Zone–styled animated background

This project was chosen to explore game physics, animation loops, collision detection, and more advanced gameplay elements using only Canvas and vanilla JavaScript.
